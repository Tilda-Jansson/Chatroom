## Description

A simple online multiplayer 2D grid-based game I made with responsive design where players can move around, collect coins and change their appearance. Players can also send messages that appear as speech bubbles above their character and play background music. The web app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and Firebase.

## Features

* Responsive design that works on desktop

* Grid-based movement

* Randomized player names and colors that are customizable

* Player chat with speech bubbles

* Coin collecting

* Dynamic coin placement

* Background music with play/pause functionality

* Firebase integration for real-time data synchronization


## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have an active Firebase project and have set up your configuration in the project.

2. Include the necessary HTML, CSS, and Firebase SDK files in your project.

3. Run the project in your preferred web server.

4. Enjoy the chatroom experience!
